## 🚀 CORRECTED DOWNLOAD COMMANDS

## 🚀 CORRECTED DOWNLOAD COMMANDS

### Using PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
# Navigate to uploads folder
Set-Location "C:\Users\eacha\OneDrive\Desktop\SMART FARMER\BACKEND\uploads"

# Create a test folder
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "test-downloads"

# Note: For large datasets, use browser download or Kaggle CLI
# PlantVillage dataset is too large for simple wget/curl commands
```

### Using Kaggle CLI (Recommended for Automation):

```bash
# Install Kaggle CLI
pip install kaggle

# Configure API credentials (get from Kaggle → Account → Create New API Token)
# Place kaggle.json in: ~/.kaggle/ (Linux/Mac) or C:\Users\<username>\.kaggle\ (Windows)

# Download PlantVillage dataset
kaggle datasets download -d abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset

# Or the larger dataset:
kaggle datasets download -d vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset

# Extract
unzip plantvillage-dataset.zip -d ./diseases/
```

## 💡 CORRECTED PRO TIPS

1. **Don't Use Stock Photo Sites for Disease Images:**
   - Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay have VERY FEW actual disease images
   - They're great for UI/marketing photos only
   - Use scientific datasets (PlantVillage, Kaggle) for disease detection

2. **Dataset > Individual Images:**
   - 1 dataset download = 54,000+ images
   - Already organized by crop and disease
   - Properly labeled for training AI models

3. **Quality Matters:**
   - PlantVillage images are expert-verified
   - Consistent lighting and angles
   - Clear disease symptoms visible

4. **File Size Considerations:**
   - PlantVillage images: ~256x256 to 512x512 pixels
   - Perfect for Gemini API (< 5MB limit)
   - No need to resize

5. **Organization is Key:**
   - Keep dataset folder structure
   - Don't rename images randomly
   - Maintain crop/disease labels in folder names

## 📞 NEED HELP?

**Can't download from Kaggle?**
- Alternative: Download from Mendeley Data (no account needed)
- Link: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1
- Or try GitHub: https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset

**Dataset too large?**
- Download only specific crops you need
- Start with: Tomato, Potato, Corn (most common)
- Each crop folder is ~50-100MB

**Need African-specific diseases?**
- Check Cassava disease datasets on Kaggle
- Search: "cassava disease" or "african crop disease"
- Supplement PlantVillage with region-specific data

**Images won't extract?**
- Use 7-Zip (free): https://www.7-zip.org/
- Or WinRAR: https://www.win-rar.com/
- Check file integrity (re-download if corrupted)
