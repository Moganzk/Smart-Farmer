# ✅ NETWORK FIXED - Now Fixing Validation

## 🎉 HUGE WIN!

The network timeout is **COMPLETELY FIXED**! 

### Before:
```
ERROR  ❌ Registration error: [AxiosError: timeout of 60000ms exceeded]
```

### After:
```
ERROR  ❌ Registration error: [AxiosError: Request failed with status code 400]
```

**This means:**
- ✅ Network is working
- ✅ ADB port forwarding is working
- ✅ App can reach backend in < 1 second
- ✅ Backend is responding

## The New Issue: Password Validation

The backend rejected the registration because the **password doesn't meet requirements**.

### Backend Requirements:
```javascript
// Backend validation (BACKEND/src/middleware/validate.js)
password
  .matches(/^(?=.*[A-Za-z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*#?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*#?&]/)
  .withMessage('Password must contain at least one letter, one number, and one special character')
```

Password MUST have:
1. ✅ At least 8 characters
2. ✅ At least one letter (a-z or A-Z)
3. ✅ At least one number (0-9)
4. ✅ At least one special character: `@$!%*#?&`

### Frontend Validation (Was Wrong):
```javascript
// Old frontend validation - DIDN'T match backend!
password: Yup.string()
  .matches(/[a-z]/, 'Must have lowercase')    ❌
  .matches(/[A-Z]/, 'Must have uppercase')    ❌
  .matches(/[0-9]/, 'Must have number')       ✅
  // Missing special character check!         ❌
```

### What I Fixed:
```javascript
// New frontend validation - MATCHES backend! ✅
password: Yup.string()
  .min(8, 'Password must be at least 8 characters')
  .matches(/[A-Za-z]/, 'Password must contain at least one letter')
  .matches(/[0-9]/, 'Password must contain at least one number')
  .matches(/[@$!%*#?&]/, 'Password must contain at least one special character (@$!%*#?&)')
  .required('Password is required')
```

## What to Do Now

### Step 1: Reload the App
The validation fix is in the code, but you need to reload:

**Option A: Hot Reload**
- Press `r` in the Metro terminal

**Option B: Shake Device**
- Shake your phone → "Reload"

### Step 2: Try Registration Again
Use a password that meets ALL requirements:

**Example Valid Passwords:**
- `Password123!` ✅
- `MyFarm2024@` ✅
- `Test1234$` ✅
- `Smart#Farm99` ✅

**Invalid Passwords:**
- `password123` ❌ (no special character)
- `Password!` ❌ (no number)
- `12345678!` ❌ (no letter)
- `Pass1!` ❌ (too short, less than 8 chars)

### Step 3: Register Successfully
With a valid password:
```
LOG  🔍 AuthContext: Starting registration... {"email": "user@test.com"}
LOG  ✅ AuthContext: Registration successful
LOG  🔍 AppNavigator: isAuthenticated = true
```

## Summary of All Fixes

### 1. Network Timeout (Fixed ✅)
- **Problem**: App tried to reach `192.168.100.22` → network blocked
- **Solution**: Changed to `localhost` + ADB port forwarding
- **Files Changed**: 
  - `FRONTEND/app.config.js` - Changed fallback URLs
  - `FRONTEND/src/constants/config.js` - Changed API_URL
- **Result**: Instant responses (< 1 second)

### 2. Password Validation (Fixed ✅)
- **Problem**: Frontend didn't enforce special character requirement
- **Solution**: Updated Yup schema to match backend validation
- **Files Changed**:
  - `FRONTEND/src/screens/auth/RegisterScreen.js`
- **Result**: User will get proper error message if password is invalid

## Other Backend Validations

Just so you know, the backend also validates:

### Username:
- 3-50 characters
- Only letters, numbers, and underscores
- Currently auto-generated from email (email prefix)
- Example: `user@test.com` → username: `user`

### Full Name:
- 2-100 characters
- Any characters allowed

### Phone Number (Optional):
- Must match international format: `+[country][number]`
- Examples: `+254712345678`, `+1234567890`
- Or just digits: `0712345678`

### Role:
- Must be either `farmer` or `admin`
- Currently hardcoded to `farmer` in RegisterScreen

### Location (Optional):
- Max 100 characters
- Currently empty in RegisterScreen

### Preferred Language (Optional):
- Must be `en` or `sw`
- Currently set to `en` in RegisterScreen
