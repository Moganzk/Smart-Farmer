# 🔍 Enhanced Error Logging - Let's See What's Wrong

## What I Just Added

### 1. Detailed Validation Error Logging
Now the app will show:
- ✅ Exact field that failed validation
- ✅ Specific error message for each field
- ✅ Full registration data being sent

### 2. Enhanced Error Messages
Instead of generic "Validation failed", you'll now see:
```
Validation failed: password: Password must contain at least one special character
```

---

## What to Do Now

### Step 1: Press `r` in Metro Terminal
This will reload the app with enhanced logging.

### Step 2: Try Registration Again
Use the same data as before (or any data).

### Step 3: Check the Logs
You'll now see detailed output like:

```javascript
LOG  🔍 AuthContext: Starting registration... {"email": "user@test.com"}
LOG  🔍 AuthContext: Registration data: {
  "username": "user",
  "email": "user@test.com", 
  "password": "yourpassword",
  "role": "farmer",
  "fullName": "Test User",
  "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
  "location": "",
  "preferredLanguage": "en"
}
ERROR ❌ Validation errors: [
  {
    "path": "password",
    "msg": "Password must contain at least one special character"
  }
]
```

This will tell us EXACTLY which field is failing and why!

## Common Validation Issues to Check

### Password Issues:
- ❌ No special character: `Password123` 
- ✅ Has special character: `Password123!`

### Username Issues:
- ❌ Has @ symbol: `user@test` (generated from email with @)
- ✅ Alphanumeric only: `usertest` (should work)

### Phone Issues:
- ❌ Invalid format: `123-456-7890`
- ✅ International format: `+1234567890` or `0712345678`

---

## Expected Output

After pressing `r` and trying to register, you should see something like:

### If Password Fails:
```
LOG  🔍 Registration data: {...}
ERROR ❌ Validation errors: [
  { "path": "password", "msg": "Password must contain at least one letter, one number, and one special character" }
]
ERROR Registration Failed: Validation failed: password: Password must contain...
```

### If Phone Fails:
```
ERROR ❌ Validation errors: [
  { "path": "phoneNumber", "msg": "Please provide a valid phone number" }
]
```

### If Multiple Fields Fail:
```
ERROR ❌ Validation errors: [
  { "path": "password", "msg": "Password must contain..." },
  { "path": "phoneNumber", "msg": "Please provide a valid phone number" }
]
```

## Action Plan

1. **Press `r`** in Metro terminal
2. **Try registration** with any data
3. **Copy the full log output** here so I can see:
   - What data is being sent
   - Which field(s) are failing
   - What the exact error message is
4. **I'll fix it immediately** based on the real error!

## Quick Test Data

Try registering with this data:

- **Full Name**: `John Farmer`
- **Email**: `john@test.com`
- **Phone**: `+254712345678`
- **Password**: `MyFarm2024!`
- **Confirm Password**: `MyFarm2024!`

This should work because:
- ✅ Password has: Letter (MyFarm) + Number (2024) + Special (!)
- ✅ Phone has: Valid international format
- ✅ Email is valid
- ✅ Full name is 2+ chars
- ✅ Username will be `john` (from john@test.com)

If it still fails, the logs will show us WHY!
