## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Backend must be running** for frontend to fetch data
2. **Authentication required** for advisory endpoints
3. **Images load from Unsplash CDN** - requires internet connection
4. **Database migration is automatic** - image_url column added on seed
5. **Safe to run seed multiple times** - admin user won't duplicate

## 🔄 Updating Content

To add more advisory content:

1. **Via API** (authenticated):
```javascript
POST /api/advisory
{
  "title": "Your Title",
  "contentType": "disease",
  "content": "Detailed content...",
  "cropType": "Tomato",
  "diseaseName": "Blight",
  "severityLevel": "high",
  "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[id]?w=800&q=80"
}
```

2. **Via Database** (direct insert):
```sql
INSERT INTO advisory_content (
  title, content_type, content, crop_type, 
  disease_name, severity_level, image_url, 
  created_by, is_active
) VALUES (
  'Your Title', 'disease', 'Content...', 'Tomato',
  'Disease Name', 'high', 'https://...', 1, true
);
```

## ✨ Success Indicators

- ✅ Featured content section on HomeScreen
- ✅ 5 article cards with images
- ✅ Article titles, categories, and read times
- ✅ Author names ("Smart Farmer Admin")
- ✅ No network errors
- ✅ Smooth scrolling through articles
- ✅ Tap article to see full content

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If no images appear:
1. Check internet connection (images load from Unsplash)
2. Verify backend is running (`npm start` in BACKEND folder)
3. Check ADB port forwarding: `adb reverse tcp:3001 tcp:3001`
4. Restart backend server
5. Clear app cache and reload

### If no articles appear:
1. Verify seed script ran successfully
2. Check database connection in backend logs
3. Test endpoint: `node scripts/test-advisory-endpoint.js`
4. Check authentication token is valid

### If "Network Error":
1. Backend not running - start with `npm start`
2. ADB not connected - run `adb devices`
3. Port forwarding missing - run `adb reverse tcp:3001 tcp:3001`
