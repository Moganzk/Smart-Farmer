# üî¥ IP ADDRESS CHANGED - FIXED!

**Date:** October 16, 2025, 06:30  
**Issue:** Network Error when trying to login/register

---

## üî¥ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

Your computer's IP address changed!

**Old IP:** `192.168.100.22`  
**New IP:** `172.20.81.222`

This is why the frontend couldn't connect to the backend - it was trying to reach the old IP address.

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION APPLIED

### Updated Frontend Configuration

**File:** `FRONTEND/src/constants/config.js`

**Changed from:**
```javascript
export const API_URL = getEnv('API_URL', 'http://192.168.100.22:3001/api');
export const SOCKET_URL = getEnv('SOCKET_URL', 'http://192.168.100.22:3001');
```

**Changed to:**
```javascript
export const API_URL = getEnv('API_URL', 'http://172.20.81.222:3001/api');
export const SOCKET_URL = getEnv('SOCKET_URL', 'http://172.20.81.222:3001');
```

### Verification

‚úÖ Backend is running on port 3001 (Process ID: 13236)  
‚úÖ Backend is accessible on `http://172.20.81.222:3001`  
‚úÖ API endpoint tested successfully (returns validation error as expected)

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS - RESTART YOUR APP

### 1. Stop the Expo App
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the frontend terminal
- OR close the Expo Metro Bundler

### 2. Restart Expo
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\eacha\OneDrive\Desktop\SMART FARMER\FRONTEND"
npx expo start --clear
```

Use `--clear` flag to clear the cache and ensure new IP is loaded!

### 3. Reload on Your Device
- Shake your device
- Tap "Reload"
- OR scan the QR code again

### 4. Test Registration/Login
Try registering or logging in again - it should work now!

## üí° WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

IP addresses can change when:
- ‚úÖ You connect to a different WiFi network
- ‚úÖ Your router reassigns IP addresses (DHCP)
- ‚úÖ You restart your computer or network
- ‚úÖ You switch between WiFi and Ethernet

---

## üîß HOW TO CHECK YOUR IP IN THE FUTURE

### Windows:
```powershell
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter.

### Find current IP quickly:
```powershell
ipconfig | findstr /i "IPv4"
```

**Current IPs:**
- `172.20.81.222` ‚Üê Your main network IP (use this one!)
- `192.168.137.1` ‚Üê Virtual adapter (ignore)

---

## üì± TESTING CHECKLIST

After restarting Expo app:

- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Can see Login/Register screen
- [ ] Registration works (no Network Error)
- [ ] Login works (no Network Error)
- [ ] Profile data loads
- [ ] All API calls work

---

## üéØ TROUBLESHOOTING

### If you still get Network Error:

1. **Verify backend is running:**
   ```powershell
   netstat -ano | findstr :3001
   ```
   Should show: `LISTENING       13236`

2. **Check your current IP:**
   ```powershell
   ipconfig | findstr /i "IPv4"
   ```

3. **Update config.js if IP changed again**

4. **Make sure phone and computer are on SAME WiFi network**

5. **Restart Expo with cache clear:**
   ```powershell
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

## ‚úÖ SUMMARY

**Problem:** IP address changed from 192.168.100.22 to 172.20.81.222  
**Fix:** Updated FRONTEND/src/constants/config.js with new IP  
**Action Required:** Restart Expo app with `--clear` flag  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Backend accessible, ready for testing!

---

**Now restart your Expo app and try again!** üöÄ
