# üéØ PROBLEM SOLVED: ADB Port Forwarding

## What Was Wrong
- Mobile app couldn't reach backend at `172.20.106.222:3001`
- Login/Registration timing out after 60 seconds
- Network isolation or firewall blocking connection

## What Was Fixed
‚úÖ **ADB port forwarding configured**  
‚úÖ **Config updated to use localhost**  
‚úÖ **Direct tunnel between phone and computer**  

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. ADB connection verified: `192.168.137.166:41015`
2. Port forwarding active:
   - `tcp:3001` ‚Üí Backend API
   - `tcp:8081` ‚Üí Metro Bundler  
   - `tcp:19000` ‚Üí Expo Dev Server
3. Config updated: Now using `http://localhost:3001/api`

### ‚è≥ Next Step: RESTART METRO
```bash
cd "C:\Users\eacha\OneDrive\Desktop\SMART FARMER\FRONTEND"
npx expo start -c
```

Then **reload the app** on your phone (shake ‚Üí Reload)

## Expected Result

### Before:
```
‚ùå Login error: AxiosError: timeout of 60000ms exceeded
‚è±Ô∏è Time: 60+ seconds
```

### After:
```
‚úÖ Login successful!
‚è±Ô∏è Time: < 1 second
```

## How to Test

1. **Restart Metro** (important - config changed!)
2. **Reload app** on phone
3. **Try logging in** with your credentials
4. Should complete **instantly** now!

## If You Need to Reconnect

Run this script anytime:
```bash
setup-adb.bat
```

Or manually:
```bash
adb reverse tcp:3001 tcp:3001
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
adb reverse tcp:19000 tcp:19000
```

**üì± Now restart Metro and try logging in - it should work immediately!**
