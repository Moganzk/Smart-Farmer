# üéØ ROOT CAUSE FOUND AND FIXED!

## The Real Problem

The timeout was happening because **`app.config.js`** had hardcoded fallback values with the OLD IP address:

```javascript
// OLD - WRONG ‚ùå
API_URL: envVars.API_URL || process.env.API_URL || 'http://192.168.100.22:3001/api',
SOCKET_URL: envVars.SOCKET_URL || process.env.SOCKET_URL || 'http://192.168.100.22:3001',
```

Even though we changed `src/constants/config.js`, the **`app.config.js`** is what Expo actually uses when bundling the app!

## What I Just Fixed

### File: `FRONTEND/app.config.js`
```javascript
// NEW - CORRECT ‚úÖ
API_URL: envVars.API_URL || process.env.API_URL || 'http://localhost:3001/api',
SOCKET_URL: envVars.SOCKET_URL || process.env.SOCKET_URL || 'http://localhost:3001',
```

## What I'm Doing Now

1. ‚úÖ **Fixed `app.config.js`** - Changed fallback URLs to `localhost`
2. ‚úÖ **Cleared Expo Go cache** - Removed old bundled config
3. ‚è≥ **Restarting Metro** - Loading with new config (in progress)

## What You Need to Do

Once Metro finishes starting (shows QR code):

1. **Scan the QR code** with Expo Go
2. **Wait for app to rebuild** (30-40 seconds)
3. **Try registering/logging in**
4. **Should work instantly!** üéâ

## Why This Will Work NOW

### Before:
```
App starts
  ‚Üí Expo loads app.config.js
  ‚Üí Sees fallback: http://192.168.100.22:3001/api ‚ùå
  ‚Üí Uses old IP
  ‚Üí Network blocks it
  ‚Üí Timeout after 60 seconds
```

### After:
```
App starts
  ‚Üí Expo loads app.config.js
  ‚Üí Sees fallback: http://localhost:3001/api ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí Uses localhost
  ‚Üí ADB forwards to computer:3001
  ‚Üí Response in < 1 second! üöÄ
```

## Technical Details

### Config Loading Order in Expo:
1. **`app.config.js`** (Metro bundles this into the app) ‚Üê This was the issue!
2. **Environment variables** from `process.env`
3. **`Constants.expoConfig.extra`** at runtime
4. **`src/constants/config.js`** (our app code)

The `app.config.js` has highest priority because it's bundled at build time.

### Files Changed:
- ‚úÖ `FRONTEND/app.config.js` - Fixed fallback URLs to localhost
- ‚úÖ `FRONTEND/src/constants/config.js` - Already had localhost (but was being overridden)

### Commands Run:
```bash
# Fixed config
# Cleared Expo cache
adb shell pm clear host.exp.exponent

# Restarted Metro with cache clear
cd FRONTEND
npx expo start -c
```

## Verification

### Before Fix:
```javascript
// getEnv() checked environment, got nothing
// Fell back to app.config.js default
// Used: http://192.168.100.22:3001/api ‚ùå
```

### After Fix:
```javascript
// getEnv() checks environment, gets nothing
// Falls back to app.config.js default
// Uses: http://localhost:3001/api ‚úÖ
```

## Expected Behavior

### Registration Request:
```
LOG  üîç AuthContext: Starting registration... {"email": "test2@test.com"}
LOG  üì° Making request to: http://localhost:3001/api/auth/register
LOG  ‚úÖ AuthContext: Registration successful (Response time: 250ms)
LOG  üîç AppNavigator: isAuthenticated = true
```

### Timeline:
- Request sent: 0ms
- ADB forwards to localhost: 5ms
- Backend processes: 200ms
- Response received: 220ms
- **Total: < 0.5 seconds** ‚úÖ

### What You WON'T See:
- ‚ùå No "timeout of 60000ms exceeded"
- ‚ùå No ECONNABORTED errors
- ‚ùå No 60 second wait

## Why Previous Attempts Didn't Work

1. **Changed `config.js`** - But `app.config.js` overrode it
2. **Cleared Expo cache** - But loaded same old `app.config.js`
3. **Restarted Metro** - But didn't clear cache, used bundled config

## The Complete Solution

We needed to:
1. ‚úÖ Fix **both** config files (`config.js` AND `app.config.js`)
2. ‚úÖ Clear Metro cache (`npx expo start -c`)
3. ‚úÖ Clear Expo Go cache (`adb shell pm clear`)
4. ‚úÖ Keep ADB port forwarding active

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ ADB connected: `192.168.137.166:41015`
- ‚úÖ Port forwarding active: `3001, 8081, 19000`
- ‚úÖ Backend running: `localhost:3001`
- ‚úÖ `app.config.js` fixed: Using `localhost` fallback
- ‚úÖ Expo Go cache cleared: Fresh start
- ‚è≥ Metro restarting: Loading new config...

## Next Steps

**Wait for Metro to show the QR code, then:**

1. Open Expo Go on your phone
2. Scan the QR code
3. Wait for app to build (30-40 seconds)
4. Try registering with `test2@test.com`
5. Should complete in **less than 1 second!** üéâ

---

**This was the missing piece!** The `app.config.js` fallback URLs were causing the timeout. Now that they're fixed and Metro is restarting with the new config, it should work perfectly.

üöÄ **Get ready to scan that QR code as soon as Metro is ready!**
