        content: `Early blight is a common fungal disease affecting tomatoes. Key prevention strategies include:

1. **Crop Rotation**: Rotate tomatoes with non-solanaceous crops every 2-3 years
2. **Proper Spacing**: Ensure adequate air circulation between plants (18-24 inches apart)
3. **Mulching**: Apply organic mulch to prevent soil splash onto lower leaves
4. **Watering Practices**: Water at the base of plants in the morning to minimize leaf wetness
5. **Sanitation**: Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately
6. **Resistant Varieties**: Choose varieties with genetic resistance when available

**Early Detection Signs:**
- Dark brown spots with concentric rings on older leaves
- Yellowing around the spots
- Premature leaf drop starting from the bottom of the plant

**Organic Treatment Options:**
- Copper-based fungicides
- Neem oil spray (apply weekly during humid periods)
- Baking soda solution (1 tablespoon per gallon of water)

**Chemical Control (if necessary):**
Use chlorothalonil or mancozeb-based products following label instructions. Apply at first sign of disease and repeat every 7-10 days during wet weather.`,

**Identification:**
- White, powdery fungal growth on leaves
- Starts on older leaves and spreads upward
- Leaves may yellow and die prematurely
- Can reduce fruit quality and yield

**Cultural Control Methods:**
1. **Variety Selection**: Plant resistant varieties when available
2. **Site Selection**: Choose locations with good air circulation and full sun
3. **Spacing**: Provide adequate spacing between plants
4. **Irrigation**: Use drip irrigation; avoid overhead watering
5. **Pruning**: Remove infected leaves immediately

**Organic Treatments:**
- **Milk Spray**: Mix 1 part milk with 9 parts water, spray weekly
- **Potassium Bicarbonate**: More effective than baking soda
- **Sulfur Dust**: Apply when temperatures are below 90¬∞F
- **Neem Oil**: Apply early morning or late evening`,

**Symptoms:**
- Water-soaked spots on leaves that quickly turn brown/black
- White fungal growth on undersides of leaves in humid conditions
- Brown lesions on stems
- Firm brown rot in tubers with reddish-brown discoloration

**Management Strategies:**
1. Use certified disease-free seed potatoes
2. Hill soil around plants to protect developing tubers
3. Destroy volunteer potatoes and infected tomatoes nearby
4. Avoid overhead irrigation
5. Apply protective fungicides before disease appears
6. Harvest on dry days when vines are completely dead

**How to Improve Your Soil:**
- Apply 1-2 inches of compost annually
- Plant cover crops in off-season
- Minimize tillage to preserve structure
- Use crop rotation to prevent disease
- Mulch heavily to retain moisture and add organic matter
